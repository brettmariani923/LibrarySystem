How it works:

1. The client sends a json request

    POST /api/books
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "title": "The Hobbit",
      "author": "J.R.R. Tolkien",
      "genre": "Fantasy",
      "publishedYear": 1937
    }


2. Controller recieves the request

 [HttpPost]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Create([FromBody] BookDTO? DTO)
    {
        if (DTO == null)
            return BadRequest("Book data must not be null.");

        var created = await _service.CreateAsync(DTO);
        return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetById), new { id = created.Id }, created);
    }

        -ASP.NET Core automatically deserializes the JSON into a BookDTO object.


3. IBookService Interface is called from the controller method. The controller passes it to _service.CreateAsync(DTO) method.


4. BookService Handles the Logic

    public async Task<BookDTO> CreateAsync(BookDTO DTO)
    {
        if (DTO == null)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(DTO), "Book DTO cannot be null");

        var book = new Book
        {
            Title = DTO.Title,
            Author = DTO.Author,
            Genre = DTO.Genre,
            PublishedYear = DTO.PublishedYear
        };

        _context.Books.Add(book);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();

        DTO.Id = book.Id;
        return DTO;
    }

    -A Book entity is created from the DTO.
    -Its added to the LibraryDbContext
    -EEF Core saves it to the database.
    -The generated Id is assigned back to the DTO, which is returned


5. LibraryDbContext writes to SQLite (or In-Memory)

    -DbContext maps the Book entity to a SQL table
    -uses Fluent API to define constraints
    -writes to library.db


6. Controller Returns Response

    return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetById), new { id = created.Id }, created);

    -returns HTTP 201 Created
    -JSON representation of the new book
    -Location header pointing to /api/books/{id}



Separation of Layers — DTO != Entity

BookDTO is just a data container used for transferring info between layers (like from API → service → client).

Book is the Entity Framework Core entity that represents the actual database table row.

They’re intentionally separate types because:

The database model (Book) might have EF Core attributes, navigation properties, or relationships.

The DTO should remain lightweight — it’s just for transport, not persistence logic.

You don’t want to expose your EF Core entities directly to external layers (that breaks Clean Architecture).

So we map from DTO → Entity:

var book = new Book
{
    Title = dto.Title,
    Author = dto.Author,
    Genre = dto.Genre,
    PublishedYear = dto.PublishedYear
};
